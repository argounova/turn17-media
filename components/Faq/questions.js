        question: 'No hidden fees, huh?',
        answer: 'We do not collect any additional fees or taxes (add-ons for Spec and GT class sites are separate and discussed ahead of time).  Please note that you may be required to pay taxes on electronically delivered software in your home state.  Check your local regulations for details.',

        question: 'Is a single page website enough for me?',
        answer: 'You might be surprised at how much content can reasonbly fit on a single page site.  Modals (or pop-ups) can cover things like contact, sign-up forms, and even photo galleries.',

    {
        id: '3',
        question: 'Can I really have a website up and running in as little as 2-3 weeks?',
        answer: 'Yes!  But (there is always a but)...keep in mind that the estimated time to completion, or ETC, listed is for design and development only.  Other considerations such as securing a domain, setting up hosting and providing Turn17 Media with photos/content can add time.  If you happen to have everything else in place then there is no reason your site cannot go live at the end of development.',
    },
    {
        id: '4',
        question: 'Is a domain and hosting included?',
        answer: 'Yes, the price above includes a domain and 6-12 months of free hosting.  Certain restrictions apply such as a cap on domain cost, available bandwith, etc.',

        id: '5',
        question: 'What if I change my mind?',
        answer: 'Congratulations, you are human!  A change of mind (or heart) is understandable and not entirely unexpected.  Whether you want different colors/fonts or feel the need to switch from a Spec site to a GT site.  Your satisfaction is paramount and we will work with you on whatever the issue.',

        question: 'How many developer meetings do I get?',

    {
        id: '10',
        question: 'Can I make changes once development of my site begins?',
        answer: 'Yes and no.  It is a sliding scale so as we get futher into development, things become more difficult or time consuming to alter.  This does not mean it is not possible!  However, additional costs can be incurred due to last minute changes.',
    },
    {
        id: '11',
        question: 'What happends once my site is complete?',
        answer: 'A final review will be conducted and once everyone signs off, the site goes live.',
