        question: 'Is a single page website enough for me?',
        answer: 'You might be surprised at how much content can reasonbly fit on a single page site.  Modals (or pop-ups) cover things like photo galleries, contact or sign-up forms, and more.  There is technically no limit to how far down you can scroll on one page and features like a navigation menu and links to other parts of the same page are included.',

        question: 'Can I really have a website up and running in as little as six to ten business days?',
        answer: 'Yes!  But (there is always a but)...keep in mind that the estimated time to completion, or ETC, listed is for design and development only.  Other considerations such as securing a domain, setting up hosting and providing Turn17 Media with photos/content can add time.  If you happen to have everything else in place then there is no reason your site cannot go live at the end of development.',

        id: '4',
        question: 'Is a domain and hosting included?',
        answer: 'Yes, the price above includes a domain and six months of free hosting.  Certain restrictions apply such as a cap on domain cost, available bandwith, etc.',
