        question: 'No hidden fees, huh?',
        answer: 'We do not collect any additional fees or taxes (add-ons for GT class sites are separate and discussed ahead of time).  Please note that you may be required to pay taxes on electronically delivered software in your home state.  Check your local regulations for details.',

        question: 'Is a single page website enough for me?',
        answer: 'You might be surprised at how much content can reasonbly fit on a single page site.  Modals (or pop-ups) cover things like photo galleries, contact or sign-up forms, and more.  There is technically no limit to how far down you can scroll on one page and features like a navigation menu and links to other parts of the same page are included.',

        id: '3',
        question: 'Can I really have a website up and running in as little as eight to ten business days?',
        answer: 'Yes!  But (there is always a but)...keep in mind that the estimated time to completion, or ETC, listed is for design and development only.  Other considerations such as securing a domain, setting up hosting and providing Turn17 Media with photos/content can add time.  If you happen to have everything else in place then there is no reason your site cannot go live at the end of development.',

    {
        id: '4',
        question: 'Is a domain and hosting included?',
        answer: 'Yes, the price above includes a domain and 6-12 months of free hosting.  Certain restrictions apply such as a cap on domain cost, available bandwith, etc.',

        question: 'What if I change my mind?',
        answer: 'Congratulations, you are human!  A change of mind (or heart) is understandable and not entirely unexpected.  Whether you want different colors/fonts or feel the need to switch from a Spec site to a GT site, we got you.  Your happiness is paramount and we will work with you on whatever the issue.',

        question: 'Are your sites mobile friendly?',
        answer: 'Absolutely.  We have a mobile-first design philosophy ensuring your site will look and function beautifully no matter the screen size.',
